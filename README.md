# Curriculum Vitae

The goal of this repository is twofold: 
 - store my CV in a static, trustworthy URL. 
 - explore how much is _too much_ in the interaction between LaTeX, conditional compilation and GitHub actions. 

The end goal is to have an automatic pipeline from .tex file and all _variants_ of my CV, with and without picture, in every language. For now, work is being done on conditional compilation in GitHub Actions to compile two artifacts, with and without pic.
